@VirginAmerica This is such a great deal! Already thinking about my 2nd trip to @Australia &amp; I haven't even gone on my 1st trip yet! ;p
"@VirginAmerica help, left expensive headphones on flight 89 IAD to LAX today. Seat 2A. No one answering L&amp;F number at LAX!"
@VirginAmerica I called a 3-4 weeks ago about adding 3 flights from 2014 to my Elevate...they still haven't shown up...help!
@VirginAmerica I‚Äôm having trouble adding this flight my wife booked to my Elevate account. Help? http://t.co/pX8hQOKS3R
@virginamerica you ROCK for making it so I can watch #Oscars on my flight!! #redcarpet #oscars #oscars2015
@VirginAmerica best customer service rep in the world! #irmafromDallas takes the cake!!!
@VirginAmerica Is it normal to receive no reply from Central Baggage #baggageissues #smh
@VirginAmerica - too many apologies! You r the worse airlines! Don't even respond to your cudtomers
@VirginAmerica Because we never rec'd Cancelled Flightlation notice we were left w no options to fly out of PS. Driving to LA for a red eye Mon w kids
@VirginAmerica Your website is down and I'm trying to check in!
@VirginAmerica You have the best flight attendant ever!!! http://t.co/PxdEL1nq3l
@VirginAmerica sounds like fun !
@VirginAmerica Thanks! Good times there and back! #Vodkatonics the entire flightüç∏#sfo
@VirginAmerica cutest salt and pepper shaker ever. Just when I think you guys can't get any better you just do! http://t.co/vC6Keulg2J
@virginamerica the manage itinerary section of your website seems to be broken for me https://t.co/2pUJvCElNg
@VirginAmerica your Avis rental continue button doesn't work on your website to book car. Tried 4 times on phone.  This sucks!
@VirginAmerica gave a credit for my Late Flight flight yesterday. Great service !!!! That's a Wow moment! Unexpected gesture!
@VirginAmerica Your back of seat entertainment system does not accept credit cards that  have an apostrophe in the surname. #apostrophefail
"@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!"
@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
@united is my favorite airline.
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
@united thank you.
@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@united I will but right now I'm to angry
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi
@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
@united it won't help...been there done that.
@united today take flight to san francisco. .. refuse to let us board with baby early... time we board wont let us take baby carryon bag
@united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over
"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? üò≠
"@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!"
"@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck."
@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
@united Was able to send the DM. All good now.
@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
@united EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to youüòä http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E
"@united hi JP, with the help of an awesome TSA representative, I was able to get it all taken care of. Thank you!"
"@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight"
BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
"@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all."
@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines
". @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines"
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can‚Äôt fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
‚Äú@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML‚Äù:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
"@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good."
@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
@united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously?
@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain
@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
@united thank you
@united fuck you for not caring üò¢
@united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines!
"@united Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying ""think about your next flight..."" #customer #outrage http://t.co/KkwiwI97A4"
@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
@united flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491
@united What does delayed due to Customer Service mean for UA761?
@united Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage.
"@united 2100$ ticket,12h biz trvl,no wifi.Missed con flt,next one#24h,missed meeting,7$ food voucher,hotel chkout#12,flt#5,no wifi#hotel"
@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
"@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent."
@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
"@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed"
@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
"@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not"
"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
@united And yet we still haven't left yet and I can't watch my pre-paid DirectTV. #firstworldproblems
@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
@united having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!
@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
@united friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don't have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke
@united u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I've even though I have platinum and the other person none
@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines
@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
"@united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain"
"@united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, ""not with my hands!"" #badservice"
@united thank you for taking care of my mom and reFlight Booking Problems her flight in phl.
"@United Right now at Tropic Air in San Pedro, #Belize. Line out the door. All due to elected &amp; appointed hacks http://t.co/kKEDjNRTWo‚Äù"
@united UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE.
@united U BUMS HOW DO U LOSE THE BIGGEST BAG ON THE FLIGHT
@united customers ‚úÖ. Customer service ‚ùå http://t.co/qP6Aw3nLIP
@united DEN-PHX flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted. Asked for overnight 2nite in LAX/SNA. Told not without paying. That's wrong
@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
"@united on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites"
@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
@united My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm needing some help reFlight Booking Problems.
@united never fails to have delayed flights üò°
@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...
@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.
@United thanks to Lea in the Chicago office for her help in switching our Cancelled Flighted flights!!
@united never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best.
@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
"@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!"
@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
"@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!"
@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
@united MIA-EWR #384 üòÑüòÑüòÑ excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 üò°üò°üò° No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
"@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours"
@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
"@united thanks, i made it."
@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United.
@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
"Thank you United! ‚Äú@united: @dan_roam That's a beautiful place to stay a day longer. Have you been re-booked? If not, let me know. ^MN‚Äù"
@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE
"@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus"
@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much
"@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match."
"@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here."
"@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are ‚Ç¨67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff"
@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
@united 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection
@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
"@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated."
"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute."
@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
@united installed and working are not the same. Kicked me out after an hour and wouldn't let me back in. Four wasted hours.
@united Got a call. Bag is to be delivered tonight. Thanks for your reply!!
@united Just saying the truth. You don't even an email! #2015
@united I'm a minor and freaking out bc I might not make my connecting flight to Hawaii so yes I'm frustrated
@united They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they‚Äôre interested. Responded to your DM and no response back...
@united Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline.
@united 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good
@united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren't charged Just hung up on me!!
"@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail"
@united message sent. Thank you!
".@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now."
@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
@united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am!
@united 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife
@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
"@united @staralliance was there few weeks ago AWESOME,bright vibrant, and NO habitrails"
@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!
"@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats."
@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
"2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies"
"@united yes, I know that. The question is ""why is that still the case""? #fail"
.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
"@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline."
"@united Disappointed,UNITED did NOT feed small CHILDREN on a 5 &amp; half hour flight (Honolulu to Los Angeles), Appalling, ESP food waspaid for"
"@united UA6255 delayed out of #winnipeg because the plane was ""frozen""! #fail Will I make my connection on UA1059? #tightconnection #Denver"
@united Y do U not reply to customer refund forms??????????? #unitedairlines
"@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing"
@United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
@united Got me home amid snow &amp; Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. Thank you!
"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"
@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
"@united I can‚Äôt go back to the airport, I‚Äôm working, and won‚Äôt have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?"
@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
"@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United"
"@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out."
@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..üò°...
@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
"@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years."
"@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
@united still waiting for a reply
@SouthwestAir weather bc of system outage. Hopefully everything goes smoothly now. Thank you for follow up
@SouthwestAir 20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous......
@SouthwestAir and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail
@SouthwestAir oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane
"@SouthwestAir had to let us off the plane bc the toilets done even work! There goes my family vacay to playa del Carmen, Mexico! #neveragain"
"@SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch"
@SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first
@SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays.
@SouthwestAir flight 1614 FLL to ATL. My wife traveling with infant. Line to check baggage 200 people long due to your computer system crash
"@SouthwestAir LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can't be the only one with this issue on flight 1625"
@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.
"@SouthwestAir I ""heart"" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations."
@SouthwestAir I luv y'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna.
@SouthwestAir it's just the principle - it's hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn't give me anything #wrongiswrong
@SouthwestAir üëèüëèüëè on that Late Flightst ad. Makes me happy to be flying you in a few days. #BETHonors

@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
@SouthwestAir wifi is so slow! What is the point having one if can't get on the Internet?! Ugh...

@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
"@SouthwestAir I tweeted several times last week about flight info during storm, always a timely tweet back.  Thx! üòÑ"
@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
@SouthwestAir I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service!
@SouthwestAir ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed

@SouthwestAir you guys are so amazing for sending people to meet Imagine Dragons #DestinationDragons üòã

"@SouthwestAir Officially a customer support game of wills... 2hr30 on hold... Who's the loser here? Oh yeah, that's me."
"@SouthwestAir AH - did DM, no reply. On hold now over 2hrs. Just spent over $1k to get a United flight tmrw to get home. #lame"
"@SouthwestAir I always brag about ur service, but very disappointed today. Apparently I'll be sleeping on floor of Dallas airport tonight üëé"
@SouthwestAir why are the ticketing lines in Las Vegas so unorganized??  Mass craziness. Half of the ticketing stations unmanned.
"@SouthwestAir, answered right away for a new res, but can't rebook the people that were supposed to leave today? Worst customer service."
@SouthwestAir @ LAX is almost a mess. For some reason the express bag drop is slower than the full service line. http://t.co/ORY89eEGek
@SouthwestAir trying to get anyone on phone. Flt Cancelled Flighted. Please get me to Denver.
"@SouthwestAir are any flights leaving DC today? Flight was Cancelled Flightled, been on hold for over an hour."

"@SouthwestAir @JasonWhitely flt 947 Emer stop in Albuquer for a heart condition, crew was awesome, pilot was Maverick on the divert."

@SouthwestAir @dultch97 that's horse radish üò§üê¥
@SouthwestAir Flight 3056. Only an hour long but one of the best flights I've ever had. Kudos to flight crew and airline in general.
@southwestAir SWA agent Jacquie Plitt @Orangecounty SNA rudely tells me You're not going 2 CABO today or manana back 2 PHX flew @USAirways
@SouthwestAir thanks for the info and the quick response!
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flighting flights 45 minutes before takeoff &amp; sitting for 45 min on the runway of the rescheduled flight #badservice
@SouthwestAir make this delay go away. Maybe upgrade me and Kats seats. We are headed to Columbus.
"@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5."
@SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway.
"@southwestair three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue"
@SouthwestAir I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long.
@SouthwestAir Hi! I ‚ù§Ô∏è your company and fly all the time. I was wondering if you could please share this link &amp; read! http://t.co/lO6LghPcdU

"@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice"
"@SouthwestAir you only hear about the bad things. Flying the last to weekends, the flights and crews were awesome. Thank you. üëçüëç"
"@SouthwestAir truly the best in #customerservice.  If something goes wrong, no matter how big or small the issue was, they fix it. Thank you"
@SouthwestAir why doesn't your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline
@SouthwestAir Why can't I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends!
@SouthwestAir Unable to check in my flight. It says my itinerary is ineligible for checkin online. Go to counter. Very inconvenient!!!
@SouthwestAir  3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter
@SouthwestAir yeehaw. You found us another plane.  Thx for listening to me vent.
@SouthwestAir surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment.
"@SouthwestAir I owe you an apology. My tweet was out of frustration, not constructive criticism. I'm a SW fan &amp; LOVE your service!"
@SouthwestAir Incredibly frustrating. I emailed but still haven't received a response.
@SouthwestAir Congratulations!
"@SouthwestAir - thanks to the agent boarding 1137, ATL-AUS. Left my wallet on the inbound. He found it for me!"
@SouthwestAir Stuck on 4251 with the heat blasting to try and thaw the water lines.... Kinda disappointed for my first flight as a RR member
"@SouthwestAir thank u for not leaving me 
@me nice job running thru the airport to catch your connecting flight"
@SouthwestAir So far so good! http://t.co/16c9ex79Rk
@SouthwestAir we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
@SouthwestAir was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz
"5 hour delay = shortly?‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @brendanpshannon Brendan, we are so sorry to keep you waiting. We'll have you in the air shortly!^RS‚Äù"
@SouthwestAir you're the best
@SouthwestAir your app repeatedly crashed and failed to display my name when checking in. Was unable to use app. http://t.co/0kN7PjelZL
"@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns."
@SouthwestAir I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back.
@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.
"@SouthwestAir I was in Nashville and I had to drive 3 and a half hours to Memphis, but I made it as the plane was loading!"
@SouthwestAir I hope you're happy! You have officially become the next @AmericanAir #ProfitBeforePeople IMO you will be bankrupt by 2020
@SouthwestAir has the worst customer service on earth. Will never fly that airline again.
@SouthwestAir Thank you. I know ya'll can't control the weather. I appreciate ya'll working to get my flight rebooked the last two days.
"@SouthwestAir I was helped by a nice lady at PHX checkin. I spent 4 hours on hold in 24 hours, so might want to look at efficiency there."
@SouthwestAir Awwweesssooomee!
@SouthwestAir Thank you for the vouchers after the long wait on the runway Saturday night at BWI! I really appreciate it! #SWfan
"@SouthwestAir been on the phone for about an hour waiting..can you please answer, Thank You!  #notcool"
@SouthwestAir do you do auto callbacks so I don't have to wait on hold?
@SouthwestAir Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.
@SouthwestAir and currently as im bringing my 3 year old to the bathroom I'm being rushed by the flight attendant.
@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?
@SouthwestAir are you kidding me?  I needed help yesterday. I'm now landed and waiting for my connection.  Never will I fly southwest again!
@SouthwestAir about time! Thank you!
@SouthwestAir Karen with customer service was very helpful. Thank you for providing one bright spot in a frustrating situation.
@SouthwestAir injured at check in yesterday. U told me to go to dr. on hold with SWA for over hour trying to talk with someone. suggestions?
"@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, reFlight Booking Problems online has not worked, on my second round of hold (3 hrs now). Any other options?"
@JetBlue sounds great! Thank you!! :)
@JetBlue thanks so much!
@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople
@JetBlue You respond to complaints about cultural appropriation with more of it!?  You're  now below Spirit Airlines on my fly list.
@JetBlue @martysg Spoke to Corp. Customer Support already.  Shame.  Probably a reasonable and cheaper resolution to be had.  Regards
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/3kVkd8yRxa‚Äù + lol wow
@JetBlue Hopefully now my application for JetBlue donut designer will finally go through the proper channels.
@JetBlue Definitely! Lots of announcements and the app is great.
@JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane.
"@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form"
@JetBlue is so sloooooow today
@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
"@JetBlue ""Goodwill"" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136"
@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
@JetBlue you're still the best
@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed
"@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??"
@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
"@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?"
"@JetBlue, your hold music sucks."
"@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!"
@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue

@JetBlue she did. she's still waiting on a callback....the lack of follow through is what's concerning. smh
@JetBlue he just went above and beyond to be helpful
"@JetBlue If this is customer service, then please call me."
"@JetBlue no, we are at a hotel.  Also, Jetblue lost my daughters luggage.  How do you lose luggage if the plane never actually left!!!"
"@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start."
"@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything."
@JetBlue quick ? Why is a person traveling w  a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn't make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/
@JetBlue serious attitude. I was in the fault for running a tad behind but before she even knew my name or my flight info she ASSURED Me

@JetBlue great flight! Great view! :-) http://t.co/Yxn00pnOav
@JetBlue perfect! Probably need some coffee to stay awake during the night ;)
@JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi?
@JetBlue haha no need to apologize üòÅ I'll be Flight Booking Problems sooner than Late Flightr. I love JetBlue
@JetBlue can't wait! I'll be the one who can't contain herself. üòÑ
@JetBlue no updates on anything! All we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked.
@JetBlue I left my apt 10hrs ago to go from Boston to SJC and I'm still NYC. Please bring back the nonstop flight. #jetblueBlues
"@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight..."

@JetBlue Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site.
"@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?"
"@JetBlue has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService"
@JetBlue Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
@JetBlue not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can't assign me a seat?
@JetBlue loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited
@JetBlue thank you will do!! You guy are awesome!
@JetBlue definitely!
@JetBlue I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had
@JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY??
"@JetBlue yes, with about 20 minutes to spare.  FYI - your employees are amazing.  Keep up the good work!"

"@USAirways what is wrong in Boston? Why are only your plains not leaving tonight? Son needs to get back to state college, PA"
"@USAirways @AmericanAir Thank you for a couple of easy, hassle free flights today, professional and friendly staff made everything easy!"
"@USAirways any way to tell our gate we are going? Stuck on tarmack, int'l flt FLT 878 going to ELM Gate F6"

@USAirways really? 8 hr delay in Virgin Island and not even a food voucher.
"@USAirways Gave up after more than 2 hours on hold. Still need that receipt; last time it was promised, it never arrived. Help?!"
@USAirways i have been tryng to rsrv a flight over the phone over the past 4 days and keep getting an automated message to call back?!?!?!
@USAirways thanks for making me check my bag when the space was empty and to the flight attendant for the dirty look http://t.co/9rx5HOmM25
@USAirways has the WORST customer service and their flights are always delayed
@USAirways we've now learned to never fly with u again. You've lost 16 customers from our group + the hundreds more from our company
"@USAirways 6 hours, no agent. Should I keep waiting?"
@USAirways you have got to be kidding me!  No info on 4565 from DCA to BGR and your phone line tells me to call back Late Flightr?
@USAirways this is how concerned your gate attendants at C26 are this afternoon. #nocommunication #nocrew http://t.co/hFjYN2vtVj
@USAirways Just Cancelled Flight every flight I have why don't you.
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flighted &amp; rescheduled my flight &amp; still getting updates &amp; can't find my current flight on my account http://t.co/8Je1h3666w

@USAirways now you just hang up on me. I‚Äôm starting to think this is personal!
"@USAirways 30 min delay for mechanics to replace rivets. 30 mins Late Flightr, turns out mechanics had wrong size rivets. 35 more mins. Pathetic"
@USAirways your service in Philly is unacceptable. Look into better service‚úåÔ∏è a 16 yr old shouldnt have a hard time http://t.co/WDAKTmr7Mj
@USAirways on delayed flight from Phil to stt and looks like we'll miss the car ferry to at john where our lodging is. Help with housing?

@USAirways over 2 hours and 14 minutes on hold and counting. Thanks for the help! #customerservice #brutal http://t.co/VsKXyAmnom
"@USAirways can you get me home to Syracuse? After 6 Cancelled Flightled flights, one re routing three of us are sitting in Charlotte"
@USAirways @British_Airways three hour flight delay. On the phone for 45min and counting.
@USAirways Thanks to the friendly US Airways staff that helped me get booked on various flights to get home today.  Almost there!
"@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure"
@USAirways color me confused but why would i need to call and do this. Update your procedures and policies. You can see who is connecting
"@USAirways first flight Cancelled Flightled, connecting flight delayed so will completely miss next connection no response on hold 2 hrs HELP me"
"@USAirways between 3 of us, it is costing over $1000 to get home TODAY for no reason... Where do I send my receipts to be reimbursed?"
"@USAirways how aggravating, zone 5 boarded, overhead empty but forcing bag check. Better not loose bag again! flt1727 http://t.co/w3XS6TVpZg"
@USAirways 40 minutes in baggage claim and no sign of luggage from our flight. UsAirways- your incompetence is overwhelming
"@USAirways your customer service is a joke. First a mechanical Cancelled Flightation, now weather. On hold since 5:30 am. No humans. Pls call me!"
"@USAirways 100 feet from the gate at PHL, but no ground crew. You can't make this up."
"@USAirways flight today Cancelled Flighted  in phl, dozens of other flights still going. On hold for 3hrs. I need to get to my job interview!!!"
"@USAirways my brother @BRizzyberg27 missed his flight traveling home for a funeral and can't get through to the call center, can you help?"
"@USAirways Flight Cancelled Flightled due to ""weather conditions"" in arrival city. Uh...I don't think so."
@USAirways ANSWER THE BLOODY PHONE!
@USAirways once again your company actualy put people in weird situations.Your hostel voucher was fake.Snow is ok but no lies please
@USAirways flight to Des Moines Cancelled Flightled. Unacceptable to be booked on flight on Tuesday because of work commitments. 2hrs on hold
@USAirways on hold now over 2 hrs on one phone hung on 5 x on another? How do you reach a person? No weather condition makes this excusable!
@USAirways you guys suck at JFK tonight -- oh this MORNING!!!
@USAirways thanks! http://t.co/pD7R1lL6Re
@USAirways is the worst. Why on earth would @AmericanAir merge with them? I won't be flying either of them any time soon.
@USAirways still waiting on your reps to show. Now 40 mins into waiting in below freezing weather waiting for a cab.
"@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city"
@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
@USAirways I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect?
@USAirways You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home?
@USAirways please help on hold 3 hours can't change flights I'm stuck here
"@USAirways Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion."
@USAirways That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015
‚Äú@USAirways: @TMadCLE We don't like to hear this. We're sorry that it's taking so long to get through.‚Äù Stop sending generic responses
@USAirways you're right it's not fun. Especially when I don't have much of a choice. Lol. #curvygirltravels
@USAirways how is it that my flt to EWR was Cancelled Flightled yet flts to NYC from USAirways are still flying?
"@USAirways We did. @AmericanAir said to open one with you, too."
"@USAirways to a booked hotel for the night so I had to find him a room at midnight. Then say his bags will be on the plane, but can't (2/3)"
"@USAirways Yes, it's February. Bad weather happens every winter. If you guys don't have the business sense to forecast that I'm at a loss."
@USAirways now what? You Cancelled Flightled my flight again... Are you paying for my hotel?
@USAirways @AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG ?#SOS ITIS BEING LOST FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS ! #POORCUSTUMERSERVICE
@USAirways  ! THE WORST in customer service. @USAirways ! Calling for over a month to book a flight! #poorcustomerservice #usairwaysfflyer
@usairways I get extended hold times due to the weather...but 2-1/2 hours on hold (and counting). HELP!!
@USAirways Easily the most ridiculous experience trying to spend money with your company.
@USAirways - been on hold with reservations for over 30 min already! #worstairline
"@usairways when trying to check-in online, it says to call...now I've been on hold for 2 hours...what to do?"
@USAirways I fucking hate your customer service. I've been on hold all morning trying to figure out why you Cancelled Flighted my flight.
"All followers please note that @USAirways is not taking customer service calls, nor responding by helping via soc. media #dontflyusairways"
@USAirways incapable of seating a 2yo and mom together. Toddler in his own row #fail @CNN
@USAirways no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that.
"@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes..."
"@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?"
"@USAirways literally the worst flying experience of my life, and I have flown a lot"
@usairways I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP?
@USAirways  2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold
@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
"Is it insulting that @USAirways @AmericanAir offer a ""non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip"
@USAirways Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up.
@USAirways How do I get through?
@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
@USAirways Melinda in reservations in greensboro nc is an absolute jewel thank her for me she's amazing!!!
@USAirways thank you!
@USAirways delayed I'm charlotte big surprise
"@USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could've handed this one better. http://t.co/By3vDioSUA"
"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
"@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me."
@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
"@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days."
"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
@USAirways over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter
@USAirways I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.
@USAirways #tbt every day.
"@USAirways of course! ""Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch"" it's not the fact, it's the attitude!"
@USAirways that's it?!?!?
@usairways hey just letting you know you're the worst fucking service I've ever used thanks for nothing
@USAirways just called reservations.  Cannot change just able to put note on res.  Problem is tsa...
@USAirways plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW. The 810 PHL &gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight. Gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th #GTH239
@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
@USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways
"@USAirways captain on flight 1712 from PHX-PHL at 3:55 tonight was hilarious. ""Greetings from the pointy end of the airplane"" haha thanks!"
@USAirways no your not!
@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
"@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers."
@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
@USAirways I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today.
@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
@USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys
@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
"@USAirways ""admirals club"" at CLT has rude, and ignorant front desk staff...@AmericanAir you have fallen so far...THANKS DOUG PARKER!!!"
@USAirways thanks.
@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
"@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone."
@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
"@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again"
@USAirways thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. This flight is significantly better now!
@USAirways Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$?
@USAirways still can't get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes

@USAirways Worst experience ever. Unable 2 help over phone and told at last min cabin crew unavailable for flight. Never again #USAirways
@usairways missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail
@USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.
@USAirways thanks for your help! I left a message for DCA lost and found. Fingers crossed we find it!
@USAirways freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday
@USAirways contd.. They put her on 7 pm flite tonite. I think she's on now. Worst customer service ever! U need to fix it.
@USAirways  thank you! Glad to be heading home! Great people at your call center!
"@USAirways so i ask for ice and the attendant snaps ""i dont have ice on this cart"" not 5 min Late Flightr 2 cups of ice to the people 2 rows ahead."
@USAirways 2 and a half hours on hold... Hope it feels good to be a steaming pile of shit.  @AmericanAir paid far too much for you.
@USAirways Total BS... I offered to pay for a full First Class airfare ..Told Sold out.. 3 seats and they gave the seats to others... #crap
"@USAirways And really, it's a middle initial versus middle name. All else the same. Not spending my time on your computer issues."

@USAirways It's the rude and arrogant gate personnel. Uncalled for. Unprofessional. #theworst
@USAirways I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for.
"@USAirways I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That's unacceptable. I'm willing to wait on hold, but that's not an option."
@USAirways can I get free wifi since the flight 1808 was Cancelled Flightled?
@USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par.
@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain
"@USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part..."
"@USAirways me too. In the future, have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed"
@USAirways you are horrendous.  Pull your shit together
"@usairways and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight."
@USAirways No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model?
@USAirways Don't tell me that. Tell me what I can actually DO to reach someone. I don't mind being put on hold but it won't even do THAT.
@USAirways Just contaced EYEWITNESS NEWS about the ripoff the Cancelled Flighted now they want me to pay
@USAirways still crickets from customer service.
@USAirways @AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold
"@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers"
"@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest"
@AmericanAir narrowly made standby...lots of snags this trip!
@AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
"@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh."
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
"@AmericanAir ""Airport snow removal method #22...""

@AmericanAir thanks
@AmericanAir still waiting for a flight... I should get my money back
@AmericanAir thanks so much!
@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
@AmericanAir I am trying to change the time of a flight I already purchased and was told I have to pay a $400 change fee. Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir and it's not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It's A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
@AmericanAir Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day
@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
@AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
@AmericanAir my boss is :)
"@AmericanAir No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home."
"@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?"
@AmericanAir watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print
@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
@AmericanAir 140 characters aren't enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are
@AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
@AmericanAir are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you!
@AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
"@AmericanAir too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should've bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning"
"@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?"
@AmericanAir WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude üò°üò°
"@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?"
"@AmericanAir no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around"
"@AmericanAir you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks"
"@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event"
@AmericanAir they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
"@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow."
@AmericanAir 2hr and 20 min delayed...still waiting...you need to do something to improve... http://t.co/1m36NTPTR8
@AmericanAir Late Flight again geez flt2417 #Late Flight #delays #typical
@AmericanAir unable to access the website.  Will try again.
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response. Much appreciated!
@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
"@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed."
@AmericanAir why did you drop my call. Why don't you have more people answering phones? Why is it always high call volume when I call
"@AmericanAir thanks, me too"
@AmericanAir my Mistake multibillion dollar company
"@AmericanAir I have got a flight for
The next day !! What about a credit ! You guys are a multimillion dollar company give us back a Credit"
@AmericanAir misplaced my bag 36 hr ago and can't tell me where it is. I've lost $1000 of stuff :( #AmericanAirlines #unamericanairlines
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled two flights from Miami to Nashville yesterday and could not get me on a flight for 3-4 days. #Southwestairwasthere
@AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac in CLT because the our gate is not open. Hope I don't miss my connection.... #logistics #AmericanView
"@AmericanAir I waited on hold for two hours, only to have my call. Really unreliable."
@AmericanAir I bought a plane ticket 2 months ago and still haven't received my flight info and ticket in my email when it will come?
@AmericanAir I took the day off from work and drove 9 hours round trip to rescue my daughter and 3 other students from LaGuardia. Thanks!
@AmericanAir and just bad cs! I will be back on @JetBlue  at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble
@AmericanAir I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything
@AmericanAir Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag!
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting!
@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
@AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
@AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.
@AmericanAir there's an employee at gate 45 of JFK telling people their bag doesn't fit and needs to be checked when it clearly fits #AA291
"@AmericanAir Miami-PhL flight Cancelled Flightled just as I got to the gate. No one from AA around, no one on the phone. Awful awful awful."
"@AmericanAir hah, best flight attendant response, if you not happy getting screwed over, you have other carriers.   hahahah pathetic"
@AmericanAir will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again......
@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
@AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
"@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions."
"@AmericanAir Thanks gang! Mind if I ask, do you handle all of your Social Media in house?"
@AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir how can I when system always hangs up on me?
@AmericanAir you said this last time. It doesn't take 6 weeks to reply to an email.
"@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability"
@AmericanAir I've been trying to reach your customer service for TWO days. I have received zero response. Never traveling AA again.
@AmericanAir @CNN @nbsnewsr @cnnbrk except you aren't working with her @AmericanAir youve done nothing to help
@AmericanAir Funny you should say that. I have been monitoring since January 1st. No change in availability. #fakeawards #LUVisbetter
@AmericanAir delayed flight six hours. Missed international connection= extra night in a hotel and still have to pay for a 15lb surfboardbag
"@AmericanAir thanks! a response is better than nothing at all {ahem, @USAirways}"
"@AmericanAir So much for Status, EP and 1.5 million miles.  Revenue First class ticket and Im sitting in Coach thanks your rude CS staff"
"@AmericanAir the customer service today is unsat, Flight cnx, not notified, called for 6 hours and the phone line does not even let me hold"
@AmericanAir I'm still patiently waiting for a response to my complaint email on Fri. What is the normal response time?
@AmericanAir I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous
@AmericanAir please improve business extra flight reservation process. can't book online?  what century are we in? 25 min+ on hold
@AmericanAir what response? Is our flight out of Montrose Cancelled Flightled or not?
@AmericanAir yes. Just sayin' that was a particularly poorly handled situation.
"@AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was ""no longer available"" just because it wouldn't accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC"
"@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?"
@AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N
"@AmericanAir it's more than technical problems. #frustrated #answerthephone 
Res. on hold and can't get thru to use a credit to pay for it"
@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs
@AmericanAir Deplaned for the 3rd fucking time. Fuck you AA.
"@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take ""18 hours"" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is ""the best we can"""
@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
@AmericanAir now you change my gate and don't tell me? What the fuck is wrong with you people. Learn to do your fucken job
last trip on @AmericanAir ... Poor customer service 3 trips in a row! @Delta here I come!
"@AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ?"
@AmericanAir no email no phone call no nothing. You've screwed with my flight and my family/Friends flights. You Cancelled Flighted reservations for
@AmericanAir that is absolutely false stmt.  You have a comedy of errors incl no catering etc #GetYourActTogether
@AmericanAir . Death of a dear friend has me heart broken but #AmericanAirlines has me heated!
@AmericanAir I Love American Airlines :D
@AmericanAir no date on when revieving our money sent a letter in post and several emails no reply?? very frustrated
@AmericanAir - cruel &amp; unusual to Cancelled Flight flight w/o notice &amp; make someone stay on hold for 30min &amp; listen to the same ad in a loop
@AmericanAir its now 17 days since I contacted customer relations... #surf #fail #BaggageDrama http://t.co/CS1673hrqQ
"@AmericanAir i tried all day. Have been disconnected due to ""heavy call volume."""
@AmericanAir Thanks :-) Good to be back safely. See you again soon!
@AmericanAir Please stop changing my flights for Spring Break. This is the 5th time!
@AmericanAir been on hold for for over two hours. After waiting 2 hours earlier. Can't get any info on my reservation. How is that ok?
@AmericanAir are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me üò≠
@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you
"@AmericanAir but really, can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call"
@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
@AmericanAir Thanks for the champagne  AA153 ORD-NRT to celebrate my #TokyoMarathon2015 finish! http://t.co/Ij4xL01tKX
@AmericanAir why arent callings going thru it doesnt have me wait or anything and automated stuff is messed up
@AmericanAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
"@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company."
@AmericanAir @ArminRosen @ggreenwald Tell that piece of shit to get fucked... I'll fly exclusively with you for life...
@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
@AmericanAir it's been 2 hrs of wait on the phone a) worst customer services b) trying to know where my suitcase Is and way MORE üò§#ANGRY
@AmericanAir - I am Platinum.  I am flying USAir and they have stranded me in CLT.  Not answering phones. Did not rebook me.  Please help?
"@AmericanAir is the new @SpiritAirlines, and both are worse than taking the @GreyhoundBus #americanairlines #nocustomerservice #fail"
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"
@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins"
@AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer‚Äôs vacation. it was joke watching those ‚Äúwe care thanks for choosing us‚Äù videos
@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
@AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed?
"@AmericanAir Still sitting in airport as 6:05 flt delayed until 6:55...but still not boarding, what is happening?  No info...."
"@AmericanAir @sa_craig no gate agent, and only 3 PA updates for 3 hours, hinted at abandonment. horrible experience for all passengers."
@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head
"@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly."
"@AmericanAir Where are your ticket offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use voucher on website, what a headache! PLEASE HELP!"
@AmericanAir @dfwairport  Have been trying to get canx flight resched since noon.  got 2 call backs but call disconnects as soon as I answer
@AmericanAir you suck worst airline ever I will never be flying you again I have been stuck here for 13 hours no one is helping #fuckoff
@AmericanAir Still waiting on bags from flight 1613/2440 yesterday  First Class passenger not happy with your service.
@AmericanAir no response to DM or email yet.  customer service?
@AmericanAir Yes. Your service in GUC sucks. Your gate agent pushed a passenger and has been rude to everyone since we got here.
"@americanair hi, you Cancelled Flightled our flight back to the US and now won't take our call. What are we supposed to do?"
"@AmericanAir been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind."
@AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through...
@AmericanAir missing a full days of work thanks guys
@AmericanAir fix the engine of flight AA3031so I don't spend all night in your airport so I can fly home tomorrow
@AmericanAir I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious. I am NOT happy nor will I EVR fly w/ u again.
"@AmericanAir When I left Orlando, I was 2nd in line for standby. I land and I'm 4th. 'Priority members get first available seats'. Awesome."
"@AmericanAir no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that"
@AmericanAir we've been on hold for hours.
"@AmericanAir I used the ""call back"" feature with an operator regarding my flight, got a call 2 hours Late Flightr and got hung up on. #pleasehelp"
"@AmericanAir I need to be at work tomorrow at 8am, therefore that doesn't help.  Direct message faster than calling 800 number? #Backwards"
"@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 55 mins about my Cancelled Flighted international flight. Am out of country, so can't leave a call back #. Help?"
@AmericanAir leaving over 20 minutes Late Flight. No warnings or communication until we were 15 minutes Late Flight. That's called shitty customer svc
