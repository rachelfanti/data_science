-2	tel a doc before liv on go acquisition is just zoom doctor. that business have a lot competition, everybody think they can do it, amazon, walmart etc. however, liv on go changes the picture since thereâ€™s data science part not so easy to replicate. itâ€™s dead money until liv on go pick up.
0	because beyond that they donâ€™t agree on anything. people think the a version to data science and fact is a far right thing. itâ€™s just a general right thing.
3	blair!! thank you. i will check the dates and see what i can spin up. i'm more data science than data sec *right* now but i also think i'd love to see what the community is up to!
-1	this is something we think deeply about when we apply technology to criminal justice reform efforts: understanding the unintended consequences of it's use. and another reason why clear data science and software ethic statements are so important.
0	data will be provided at the discretions of company to whom they think is appropriate to be provided. those who think its not x can prove by generating their own data. i am into data science too, but i don't need data to understand..

1	probably unpopular opinion, but i think itâ€™s great. basic stats and data science is probably more broadly relevant than calculus these days. plus it sounds refreshing, and if done well, it will make school much more fun and help with data literacy :)
-1	model creation and deployment doesnâ€™t need to be so difficult! find out why your peers think weâ€™re the best software for citizen data scientists.

1	i would think that it is fiscal policy that is supp posed to show â€œcompassionâ€? like open mindednessâ€¦the federal reserve is supposed to follow the data (science)??
0	definitions: data science is "the use of analytical and computational techniques to extract meaning from novel data sources usually for the sake of supporting organisational decision making" -&gt; i like this definition, going to think of how to distil it down for easier use myself
-1	i am trained in data science but you don't need to be to understand a graph. how can you compare september? no one was vaccinated last september as you well know. if you don't think the vaccine works on variants then that is contradicting all scientists who have stated it does.

1	i think we are starting to get that u are a doctor. i sell software so data is a big deal. we call it data science so show us your science on texas co vid since march please doctor.
0	i totally agree with this, but i am not sure "data science == data cleaning/processing", b/c data science includes modeling. so people can think they do/teach ds without teaching/doing data processing.
1	i think econometrics or stats pairs best here. because those outputs are meant to be looked at by a human. software engineering style data science less so.

0	what year was data science was created as a job i personally think the person should get % compensation for using their data
1	in my case it was "learn a thing that people think you have to be really smart to understand, whether or not that's true". in my case, that was functional programming. a few years later the hot ticket seemed to be data science. right now it still seems to be machine learning.

1	just out of interest: would people who left academia yrs ago, with zero scientific achievements since then, but lots of real world data science experience even stand a chance, you think? asking for a friend, obviously.
0	i donâ€™t think in most big name pubs even the journalist writing the story can directly control the headline. copy editors and data science is usually responsible.
1	title: good data scientist, bad data scientist : "data scientist" is a pretty good language to describe data. i think this is a fair title in terms of how to write a data scientist. the term is ambiguous but as the article points out you don't need to do a data scienceâ€¦

0	so many people say of sports analysts "you think you know everything" but data science has taught me so much about uncertainty and now i see how so many people are certain of things there is no evidence for.
-1	i understand your point that it cuts back on hospitalization and death but do we know where are we heading? thereâ€™s no data/science to support that. watch dr. faucciâ€™s segment and think how we can have real world data when thereâ€™s no other country had done what we are doing.

1	what evidence? anecdotal? "i sat next to a vax xed person and now i'm late for my period", however amusing. is not good data. science is not progressed by rumour...otherwise we'd all still think the earth was flat.

1	iâ€™ll definitely be a listener going forward, iâ€™ve been reading a lot more data science articles on pff and itâ€™s fascinating stuff, the name unexpected points is good but i think your podcast might benefit from having more of a clear identity that people will click for
1	oh wow, really strikes a cord. i agree with you, but i need to mull over a possible alternative vocab word. i joke that we aren't the data science team, we're the smart team that solves difficult/ impossible problems. (we do ds and de) . will need to think of short word alts.

2	gosh, so love being mans plained to about science. as it happens, when you do this type of data comparisons, your first key comparison is to "most similar" entities. if you don't think so, tell me what your data science or bio stat credentials are.
-1	data science is weird, sure that being corrected means more as functional statistic of your slow pace in learning than it does your open-mindedness. this i think is also why a i &amp; machine learning are so important to finesse accuracy out of hard to separate concepts in e-learning

1	very excited to see at data architecture is more important than ever and it will be exciting to hear how to think about it for modern challenges including data science, massive unstructured datasets, and cloud environments.
1	indeed. i think this is true for the process of science as a whole (and what it's what i like about it). in data science the iterations just come at a faster rate compared to other fields.
0	iâ€™ll go off on one on this. i think our exploratory and interactive data science indirectly gives us the answers we want by iteratively refining and changing our questions of the data. we donâ€™t really know what we want when we start.
-1	finding relevant data from such a huge data set is a challenge even for a trained statistician or data scientist. if some journalists think they can easily come out with statistics, govt and big it should be shutting down all data science departments. n/n
-1	understandable. but i do think thereâ€™s a difference between ignoring data/science and ignoring bureaucratic â€œexpertsâ€?. unfortunately, those very experts ignore the data and science themselves for political reasons. eg, the cdc summer camp guidances and school openings.
0	i think part of the problem is that computational biology /bioinformatics has no academic home. it was chopped up between biology, computer science, stats, applied math, physics or even more recently stats -&gt; data science ! without dept of comp biol, it lacks identity.
-1	yea i understand a lot of data science don't feel the benefits by learning more comp sci. i reject this because what i end up seeing a lot are folks who see everything as tables, who write inefficient algos to retrieve data, use memory and don't really think about concurrency...
-2	so why do data scientists think that stats is dead? where does the notion that there is no longer any need for statistical analysis come from? and are they right?

-2	this hurts to say as a data science person, but i think lands is a net negative for limited *on its own terms*. many have argued that itâ€™s bad b/c players use the data wrong, but i think itâ€™ll be worse once the formulas are ironed out and people use the data correctly.

-2	the problem is that we often times don't understand the underlying biological process, or worse, we think we know and we don't. i do think that feature engineering in biological data science is really inescapable and that requires, to some degree, a theory of the data generation.
0	easy path. on this path, you will get lots of practical skills but only an intuitive sense of the theory. i think the easiest way to start is to read a good data science book and get your hands dirty. i like to recommend "r for data science" for that.

0	i've now spoken to multiple college students who studied cs/eng and are trying to decide between software engineering and data science. i think people know swe work is highly valued by industry, but data work might be more interesting as a career, hence the dilemma thinking_face
2	it is thicker than your rest of the books i have. i think beginning data science with r is thicker. love your writing and it is strange that i like r and c programming both. will definitely buy this.
-4	yes iâ€™ve seen him call out a few things. i think they could be working in tandem with and calling out the government to provide the data/science behind these devastating lockdowns.
-1	what you think youâ€™ll be asked to do at work after a data science degree: â€œbuild a model with this data to predict xâ€? reality... them: â€œi want our department to use mlâ€? ds: â€œis there a particular problem &amp; dataset?â€? them: â€œyouâ€™re the expert. find outâ€? (/)

1	cool. may be this summer iâ€™ll do some investigating. i donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any reason high why high school students with a little bit of math background couldnâ€™t do the data science course i currently teach at mac, esp. if it were taught over a whole year.
2	iâ€™d love to see some effort at this in mn. in spps, no high schools appear to offer data science. i think a great place to start would be at high schools that do not offer calc. if you have ideas about who to talk to, iâ€™d love to start.
2	personally, i think so. heâ€™s elevates the performance of every player. heâ€™s managed to form a balanced xi despite not having a dm or rw. heâ€™s shored up the defense significantly. heâ€™s made advances in the academy, data science, health depts. all around positive.
0	i think if "becoming competent" is someone's limiting factor then it's a losing battle. - months of disciplined practice and training can get you pretty good at most digital skills, from video editing to data science.
1	i think the whole field is super squishy on a definition for data science. as a professional society leader, iâ€™ve been pushing for us to have some good cross-sector convos about this. i donâ€™t want this to be another math-compsci debacle.
0	the pandemic exposed the need to think about tomorrowâ€™s supply chains. how do we create resiliency and agility in the digital age? i love this explanation from cto, who says the answer lies with data science and digital twins
2	finally!! i once tried to make a spreadsheet of your narration in the videos to count funny things you say but it took too long!! (also i stopped after videos i think)as a data science student iâ€™d love to analyze them one day â˜ºï¸?
1	stats is definitely more useful than i used to think when i started my university journey. now the question is: - how much stats can you learn without calculus? - what do we add to stats to make it data science? are we implicitly including some compsci / coding there, or ???
-3	i don't think it's a stretch to say that if statistics and data science were presented as the end goals to me instead of needing to do calculus (which i failed, miserably), my life would look very, very different right now.
0	artificial intelligence (ai), and data science, have become the two most important sought-after technologies in todayâ€™s world. many people think that both are the same, but they are not. letâ€™s dive deeper into terms you need to know. read:
1	probably unpopular opinion, but i think itâ€™s great. basic stats and data science is probably more broadly relevant than calculus these days. plus it sounds refreshing, and if done well, it will make school much more fun and help with data literacy :)
1	i have given "what is data science?" talks to high schoolers, and they're fascinated by it. i think giving them a taste of what you can do with statistics and data (and what kind of careers require that background) will motivate them to go further with math in college.
1	probably unpopular opinion, but i think itâ€™s great. basic stats and data science is probably more broadly relevant than calculus these days. plus it sounds refreshing, and if done well, it will make school much more fun and help with data literacy :)
0	i see. yeah that might turn out problematic for some. still i think stats and data science will be more useful to most. i have to admit that i have no idea how the us school system works but it seems that offering calculus classes for those who are interested might be good
0	sure, calculus is important, too, but probably more later in life. personally, i paid zero attention to calculus in school because it was just so boring and i couldnâ€™t see why itâ€™s useful. i think with data science, itâ€™s easier to keep students engaged. /

-1	i think is trying to appeal to both the data science supporters and the voting fraud deniers. failing at both.
2	personally i think shifting to do more data analysis and a little data science is a really good thing, as are increasing pathways and broadening our understanding of what math is. however i want to make sure all ss have the foundations they need to succeed in college. precalc?
2	you think china doesnâ€™t have reserve â€œintellectual capacityâ€?? you should peek your head into the data science orgs of every large company and ask where their employees were born. the us will win because of democracy and free trade. not because people on our soil are superior

0	i think she should explore data science /visualization. it might tickle her fancy. it tickled mine and i studied finance.
0	that looks highly interesting! unstructured and/or poorly collected, managed, and recorded data is the bane of my existence. iâ€™ve gotten quite good at parsing excel sheets with multiple tables and missing link information, but man is it tedious. i think data science is a must!
0	really careful data science doesn't just uncover patterns, it aims to ensure that the reason you *think* the pattern is occurring is actually the reason it is occurring. the history of science is riddled with examples of how this isn't always the case.
1	great talk with re: invisible labor in data science. a solid reminder to ritual ize how you build your narrative/story (i.e., brag doc, weekly snippets). people often under communicate tasks they think aren't fancy. csv conf
2	i think you folks rock - i really appreciate the work you are doing and as a data science engineering person i have to think that there are people using your work to help make decisions. itâ€™s really good analysis and work ryan !
1	i will be more than happy to discuss this matter in depth. i do believe i can offer some ideas; based on my learning experience in the domain. as a data science graduate, i want to see more professionals in the domain and i think this program could be so much better.
